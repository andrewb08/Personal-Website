[AJ Salgado Hitter Plot](AJ Salgado Hitter Plot.pdf)

Above is a sample report I've created from my time with UCLA Baseball.

This report is generally built for single game recaps of each hitter's 
performance. The flexible nature of the code allows for the report to be
used for cumulative weekends, months, or seasons as well. This is a report
from the entirety of the 2024 season. 

Through the plot being color coded, you can see where Salgado struggles with
pitches or creates hard contact. This is extremely useful for instant
feedback and improvement for batters, but can also be used for season-long
developmental goals.
