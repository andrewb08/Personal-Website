The flexible nature of the code allows for the report to be used for cumulative weekends, months, or seasons as well. This is a report from the entirety of the 2024 season.\nThrough the plot being color coded, you can see where Salgado struggles with pitches or creates hard contact. This is extremely useful for instant feedback and improvement for batters, but can also be used for season-long developmental goals."
