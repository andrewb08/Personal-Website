[Caedon Kottinger Movement Report](kottinger.jpg)

Above is a sample report I've created from my time with UCLA Baseball.

This is what is known as a pitcher movement report. Each pitcher in baseball has a unique movement profile, AKA where the ball moves and how it gets there. It is important for analysts, players, and coaches to see how to develop, scout, or attack pitchers based on this report.

Pitch types are color coded for movement and location plot, you may also notice different play results are coded by shape in the location plot.

There is also a small digestible stat table at the top of the page, from here you can get an in-depth view of the pitcher's arsenal.
